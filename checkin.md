title: 'Lab 5: Check-in'
---

During lab, we encourage you to check your understanding with a TA
after completing a section or two, while the material is still fresh
in your mind.

Each question below is a diagnostic question for each section of the
lab. Try answering one after finishing each section to test your
understanding.

1. Back in lab1, we estimated how many instructions the Pi was executing (~20 million/second).  Today you measured the timing of PS/2 clock cycle.  Calculate roughly how many instructions can be executed by the Pi in that time. Does that budget allow you to execute a call to `printf` in between reading bits? Why or why not?

2. What sequence of codes is sent when typing capital `A`?

3. In a PS/2 scancode, does the least significant or most significant data bit arrive first?

4. Show off the scancodes received by your working implementation of `keyboard_read_scancode`.

Before leaving the lab, check in with a TA and discuss any challenges
to answering the questions in the lab. If you do not feel confident
about your responses, please ask us about it too!
